# [WIP] GitHub Whisper
> Manage GitHub resources with an Eloquent-like API

## Development Disclaimer
This package's development is sponsored & mantained by [Snaptier](https://snaptier.co). While we happily accept contributions, we may priorize development according to the needs of our own product.

## Installation
You can pull in the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require snaptier/github-whisper
```

## Usage
This package exposes some eloquent-like models you can use to interact with GitHub resources. At the moment, you can only use `Repository`, `Issue` and `File`, but we'll keep adding more.

## Contributing
The development of this repository is guided by the Snaptier source code. That means that, while we'll try to accept PRs adding new functionality, we might reject contributions that clash with Snaptier's development roadmap and/or break our implementation.

We strongly suggest to open an issue first to discuss how we can implement new features/bugfixes.
